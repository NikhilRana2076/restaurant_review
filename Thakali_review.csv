chewy3000,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chewy3000,5,Authentic Lunch in the busy city with hot refills,"The Thakali Kitchen certainly is a hidden gem and I'm so glad I found it on my last day in Kathmandu. After reading reviews I was able to locate it on Maps.Me and Google by following directions to the Everest Irish Pub and the Hotel...Festoon as it is tucked away nearby. 

I enjoyed the cheaply priced yet delicious quality vegetable Dal Bhat with a set of momos and ginger tea. I was happy to receive complimentary refills on my plate from the staff. This place is a taste of real life with families and locals enjoying lunch on a busy afternoon with efficient service and traditional flavours. Well worth a visit to understand Nepal's lovely food culture.More",19-Mar-18
Martin R,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martin R,5,Best dal bhat in Kathmandu,"I was 3 months in Nepal - 4 weeks in Thamel, Kathmandu. I can warmly recommend Thakali Kitchen as the place where I enjoyed the best dal bhat (or Thakali set how they call it). In the Thakali  kitchen you can meet a lot of...local people - I guess more than 80% are locals. Its thakali set is from a price / performance ratio unbeatable (160 Rs) - as well they have a very good curry . They have a nice garden and very friendly staff. So if you are in Thamel and want to enjoy local food that is the place to go. I was there more than 10 times and it was always excellent.More",19-May-13

SrihariG1,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrihariG1,4,Hearty Simple Nepalese Food,"I wanted to try Nepalese food for the first time and was looking for an authentic experience. The Nepalese 'Thakali' style food is similar to an Indian thali. But the main difference is that the Nepali food is less spicy, and the dhal that they...use is not traditional toor dhal. The meal is simple and hearty. Free refills, definitely try once for authentic taste of Nepal.More",08-Jul-18
ola79,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ola79,3,Good but not that good,"It's an inexpensive restaurant that offer local fare but the food is not particulary tasty.

Dean-Traveller,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean-Traveller,5,Tourists welcome to taste a little of traditional urban Nepal.,In the streets of Thamel venture upstairs through the non-glamourous entrance and into a bit of real urban Nepal.

Lots of Nepali dishes available. Cold Nepali beer to complement the meal. Atmosphere and temperature warmed us on a cold evening.More,28-Dec-19
SpaceCowboy_Faye,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpaceCowboy_Faye,4,First contact with Dal Bhat,"This was our first dinner in Kathmandu and was a good choice indeed, our first contact with the local traditional dish: Dhal Bhat! The restaurant is a little bit out of the standard tourist paths and the atmosphere is a little more Nepalese; many local...people come here to have dinner and actually it was recommended to us from a Nepalese.
We really enjoyed the Dahl Bhat, it was not so spicy and the vegetables tasty and, of course, you can have free refill :)
